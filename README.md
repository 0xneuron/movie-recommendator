# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

An end-to-end Machine Learning-based Movie Recommendation System — from data preprocessing to deployment. This project is designed to learn, explore, and build real-world ML systems.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals
- ✅ Build a scalable movie recommender using classical ML techniques.
- ✅ Explore both **Content-Based** and **Collaborative Filtering** methods.
- ✅ Serve recommendations via an API (**Flask**).
- ✅ Package everything with **Docker** for deployment.
- ✅ (Future) Scale with Deep Learning and LLMs.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- **API:** Flask (WIP)
- **Deployment:** Docker + AWS/Render (WIP)
- **Frontend (Optional):** React/Next.js (Future)
- **Dataset:** [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)

---

## 🧠 Models & Methods

- **Content-Based Filtering:**  
→ Recommends based on movie metadata (genre, tags, overview).

- **Collaborative Filtering:**  
→ Recommends based on user behavior — similar users, similar ratings.

- **Hybrid Approach:** (Planned)  
→ Combines both for better accuracy.
